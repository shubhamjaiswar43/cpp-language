1. vector<data_type> vector_name(int size)
==> it is to give initial size of vector else it will be zero

2. vector_name.size()
==> it will return the no. of element present in vector

3. vector_name.capacity()
==> it will return the capacity of vector(i.e the no. of element it can store)

4. vector_name.add(data_type)
==> it will take a parameter same as the data_type the vector created to add it in vector

5. vector_name.addAt(data_type,int)
==> it will take two parameter,first the element and the second is index ,
    the element will store in index of the vector

6. vector_name.pop()
==> it will delete the last element of the vector

7. vector_name.popAt(int)
==> it will take one parameter for index ,and delete the element at that index

8. vector_name.begin()
==> it will return the address of the beginning of the vector

9. vector_name.end()
==> it will return the address of the (end+1) of the vector

10. vector_name.at(int)
==> it will take a parameter for index to return the element at that index

11. vector_name.resize(int)
==> it will take a parameter for resizing,and the change the size of the vector
    if size>newsize,then the extra element will be deleted

12. vector_name.clear()
==> it will clear the vector

13. vector_name.assign(int,data_type)
==> it will take two parameter,first for size of vector,and second for element
    and the vector will filled with that element

14. vector_name.show()
==> it will show the elements in the vector
